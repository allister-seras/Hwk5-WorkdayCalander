# Homework 5: Workday Schedule

## Description

This webpage is  designed to allow users to add tasks to specific time blocks. As time passes, the boxes will change colors from grey for the time that has passed, to red for the current hour and therefore a sign to work on tasks, and green for upcoming hours in the day. The time and date are displayed within the header so that users can keep track of the time and see how much longer they have until tasks are

## Usage

When opening the Workday Scheduler the user is met with the heading followed by the current date and time. Scrolling down displays the time blocks that range from 9 am to 5 pm on the left-hand side of the page. Users are able to type in tasks on the colored bars to the right of their desired hour block. To save these schedule items, they must click the blue save box/icon to the right of the textbox they want to save. This data is saved to local storage only and will persist upon reload.
